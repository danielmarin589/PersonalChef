# PersonalChef
I developed this project in Android Studio using Java. The app is meant to help the user decide what to cook by displaying a large range of different foods along with a recipe and a list of ingredients. The recipes which are displayed are taken from a dedicated API. There is also a separate section in which the user gets daily recommandations based on the time of day and some other handy tools such as a cooking timer and an updateable grocery list.
